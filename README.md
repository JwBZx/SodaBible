# SodaBible
Welcome to SodaBible! SodaBible is a WIP Bible App made by Jonathan Bruce (Me) and will be released under my company's name (@Soderminal).

With it (hopefully) you will be able to read the Bible (starting possibly with the ESV version), highlight verses, add notes, find your friends, and more!

This app right now is in JavaScript, but is currently in the process of being turned into a React and Meteor app.

Thank You and God Bless!
