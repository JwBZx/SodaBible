# SodaBible
Welcome to SodaBible! This is the Bible app that I want to make in the future, and I was inspired by the YouVersion Bible App and my Quiet Time/Bible reading to make this! I want to make an app like the YouVersion app that has Highlights, Friends, and more, but I want to also throw my own spin on it. "SodaBible" might not be the final name, but that's what it's going to be for now! I hope you like this project and repository, because I will definitely be updating this repository in the future! Thank You and God Bless! ---Jonathan Bruce (@JwBZx)
